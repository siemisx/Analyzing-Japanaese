# Analyzing-Japanaese 

## Project Overview
Analyzing-Japanese is designed to evaluate Japanese morphological analyzers such as Nagisa, SudachiPy, and Fugashi. I have compared and evaluated word segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and part-of-speech tagging performance using the Kyoto Web Development Leads Corpus. <br />
<br />
- Nagisa: An open-source tool utilizing recurrent neural networks, developed with a focus on user-friendliness.<br />
- Sudachi: A system based on the UniDic dictionary, offering multi-granular tokenization information. <br />
- Fugashi: A Python wrapper with Cython components for the widely used MeCab model, utilizing Conditional Random Fields.

## Structure
comparison: .py files for comparing morphological analyzers <br />
results: .txt files of tokenization and pos deiscrepancies

## Kyoto Web Document Leads Corpus
The KWDLC was used for evaluation.<br />
It consists of roughlz 5,000 documents of the first lead three sentences of web documents. <br />
It is available here: https://github.com/ku-nlp/KWDLC/tree/master

| # of documents | # of sentences | # of morphemes | # of named entities | # of predicates | # of coreferring mentions |
|---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|--------------------:|----------------:|--------------------------:|
|          5,127 |         15,381 |        252,984 |               8,363 |          67,390 |                    20,794 |

## Overview of Accuracy Results

|              | Nagisa         | Fugashi | Sudachi A | Sudachi B | Sudachi C |
|-------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| Tokenization |       86.29%   |  88.60% |   88.90% |    85.04% |    83.42% |
| POS-tagging  |         87.79% |  88.06% |   88.22% |    88.70% |    88.56% |
